# Set Circuit Colors
This redeem lets you choose the eye and circuit colors my VTuber uses! This will take effect immediately and will remain until the next time the redeem is used, the end of stream, or if I decide to change it manually myself (points will not be refunded in this last case).

The sections below explain the two different ways you can specify a color; if the provided input for the redeem does not follows the rules of either of these methods, then your redeem will automatically be refunded so you can try again.

## Predefined Color List
You may use any of these color names in the redeem input. Note that they must be spelled exactly as shown here, but are not case sensitive:

* red
* orange
* yellow
* green
* blue
* indigo
* purple

## Hex Color Code
You may also specify a direct hex (hexadecimal) color value to use in the format `#RRGGBB`. The prefix `#` symbol is required when using this method.
